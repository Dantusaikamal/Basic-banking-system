# Basic banking system

This Repo showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at The Sparks Foundation.

I'm hosting this project at Heroku.
Go to https://basic-banking-system.herokuapp.com/ to see this project live.

## How to start:

1. Clone my repository or download the zip file
2. If you're downloading the zip file, extract the zip file to a folder
3. Make sure you installed Node package manager. If not download it from here:
 ```
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/download
```
4. Open the folder with a code editor like VS code or any IDE.
5. Open terminal in the editor and enter 'npm install' 
This will install all required dependencies in the node_modules. 
6. After installing node modules, enter 'npm start' to start the development server. Happy coding! :)
